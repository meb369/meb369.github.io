    <title>Welcome to Meghan Brueggemann's Website</title>
</head>

Hello!  My name is Meghan Brueggemann and I am an orchestra director in Washington, MO for the School District of Washington.  I have a husband of almost 10 years and a lovely 5-year-old girl, Lillian. In my first semester of this degree program I took Intro to Web Development and coded a website for my program for my final project.  I feel that I have a pretty good understanding of the basics of building a page.  I would like to know more about more interactive features of building a website.  I want to be able to build a site that acts somewhat as a blog with free resources for teachers and students who find themselves out of school (like right now!)
With being full-time as a grad student, a full-time teacher, and a full-time mom, I donâ€™t have a lot of time for hobbies outside of those three areas.  I recently purchased a nice camera and, in an effort to get out of the house and get moving, have been dabbling in photography.  I would like to be able to capture high-quality shots of my family and my little girl.
