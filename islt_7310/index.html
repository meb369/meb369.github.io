        <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>I am an orchestra teacher of 12 years in the Washington School District in Washington, MO.  My primary instrument is violin, but I also play viola, cello, and bass.  I teach these four instruments to students in the 5th thru 12th grade.  In addition to teaching, I also am a member of the Webster University Chamber Orchestra as a member of the 1st violin section.  I also have a private strings studio in my community.  When I am not performing or teaching, I enjoy spending time with my family.  My husband, Dan, and I have been married almost 10 years, and we have a charming 5year-old daughter named Lillian who is starting kindergarten in the fall.</p>
